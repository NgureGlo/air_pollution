# air_pollution
Problem Statement:
Air pollution is a growing concern in urban areas, particularly in rapidly developing cities like Nairobi. One potential contributor to poor air quality is the increase in the number of imported vehicles, especially older vehicles that may emit more pollutants. This project aims to analyze the relationship between the number of imported vehicles, their age, and the level of air pollution in Nairobi. By leveraging predictive modeling, we seek to quantify the impact that vehicle imports and their average age have on air quality in the city.

Objective:
To develop a predictive model that can forecast air quality in Nairobi based on the number of imported vehicles and their average age, helping policymakers and environmental bodies to make data-driven decisions on vehicle import policies and their potential environmental impacts.

Features:
- **Air Quality Index (AQI):** A numerical measure representing the quality of air in Nairobi over a period (dependent variable).
- **Number of Imported Vehicles:** The number of vehicles imported into Nairobi (independent variable).
- **Age of Imported Vehicles:** The average age of the imported vehicles (independent variable).

Expected Outcome:
- A trained predictive model (e.g., linear regression, random forest, or a time-series forecasting model) that accurately predicts air pollution levels based on the number of vehicles imported and their average age.
- Insights into the significance of each feature (vehicle imports and vehicle age) on air quality.
- A recommendation for policymakers based on the modelâ€™s predictions, highlighting potential measures to control vehicle imports or restrict older vehicle imports to improve air quality in Nairobi.

This project will provide valuable insights into the effect of vehicle imports on air pollution, potentially helping to inform urban planning and environmental regulations.
